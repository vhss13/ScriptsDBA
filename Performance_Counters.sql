/*If you need to get information out of your SQL server (2005 or 2008) quickly, execute the stored procedure and you will get a detailed report for the following areas

- Buffer statistics - Memory statistics - General statistics - Locks statistics/Totals for Locks statistics
- TempDB statistics - Totals of Database statistics - Plan Cache statistics - Transactions statistics
- SQL error statistics - SQL statistics (SQL compilations/recompilations) - Wait statistics - SQL Execution statistics

This script displays data from the dynamic management view called: 
sys.dm_os_performance_counters and presents it in a report. 
I recommend that you look closer to this view for all your statistical 
needs.
